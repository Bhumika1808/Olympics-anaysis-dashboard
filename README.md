# Olympics-Analysis-Dashboard (Created interactive dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Objective
This project involved building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze historical data from the Olympic Games spanning over a century (1904–2016). The goal was to uncover patterns in athlete demographics, participation, and medal distribution across various sports, teams, and years.
## Dataset used
<a href= "https://github.com/Bhumika1808/Olympics-anaysis-dashboard/blob/main/dataset_olympics.csv"> Dataset used </a>
## Questions (KPIs)
How many participants were there in the selected sport?
What is the age distribution of participants?
What is the gender distribution of participants?
How many medals were won, and what types?
What is the percentage of participants who won medals vs. those who didn’t?
What is the distribution of different types of medals?
Which are the top 10 Teams for the selected year?
## Process
Verify data for any missing values and anolamalies and sort out the same.
Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
Wrote dax to get the Meaning data.
Created visuals to show the required insights.
Adjusted visuals and keen insights and applied slicers to make dynamic dashboard and find relevant insights.

## Project Insights
### Participation Trends:
There has been a steady rise in athlete participation over the years, reflecting the growing popularity and global reach of the Olympics.
### Gender Representation:
The gender gap in participation has significantly narrowed, with recent years showing a balanced representation of male and female athletes.
### Medal Distribution Patterns:
Gold medals consistently make up the highest share of total medals won across different countries and sports.
Certain sports and nations dominate the podium, highlighting their specialized strength areas.
### Performance by Teams:
In earlier Olympic years, individual clubs or regional teams (like rowing teams or naval ships) were medal winners—unlike the national teams we see today.
Teams like the United States and France have consistently performed well across decades.
### Athlete Age Range:
Athletes’ ages vary widely across sports, with participants as young as 13 and as old as 52, showing that age is not a barrier to excellence in sports.
### Interactive Analysis Value:
Adding filters for sport, year, and team made the dashboard highly dynamic, enabling focused analysis and comparison of performance across time and disciplines.
### Data Storytelling:
This project showed me how data can tell compelling stories when visualized effectively—with the right use of charts, colors, and interactivity.
## Final Conclusion
Analyzing over a century of Olympic data through this Power BI dashboard provided powerful insights into the evolution of global sports. From growing athlete participation and improving gender balance to medal dominance by certain countries and diverse age ranges of athletes, the project highlighted how data can reveal impactful stories hidden beneath the surface.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, but also deepened my understanding of sports analytics and the value of interactive dashboards for driving data-driven decision-making.
